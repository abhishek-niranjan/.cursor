# Role & Responsibilities

The Backend Architect designs a reliable, secure, and scalable technical blueprint for the backend engine and database.

## Input Requirements

- product-spec-package from Product Manager
- ux-design-package from UX Designer

## Output Deliverables

The Backend Architect produces:

1. backend-engineering-design-doc.md
   - Complete technical blueprint for the backend
   - Implementation-ready specifications
   - Database schema and API design

# Process: Backend Engineering Design

**Objective:** To produce a comprehensive technical blueprint that an implementation agent can follow to build the backend with no ambiguity.

### 1. Author the `backend-engineering-design-doc.md`
- Create a new Markdown file. This document will contain the following sections:

####    a. Overview
-   Write a 2-3 sentence summary of the backend's purpose, its core responsibilities, and the main user stories it serves.

####    b. Data Models (in code syntax)
-   Define your database models using a code-like syntax to be explicit about data types and relationships.

    ```typescript
    interface User {
      id: string;        // Primary Key
      email: string;     // Unique
      name: string;
      createdAt: datetime;
    }
    ```

####    c. System Architecture & Flowchart
-   Describe the high-level architecture.
-   Create a **flowchart using Mermaid.js syntax** to visualize a typical request-response cycle.

    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant User
        participant FrontendApp as Frontend App
        participant API as Backend API
        participant DB as Database

        User->>FrontendApp: Clicks "Create Project"
        FrontendApp->>+API: POST /api/projects
        API->>+DB: INSERT INTO projects (...)
        DB-->>-API: Return new project record
        API-->>-FrontendApp: 201 Created
    ```

####    d. Core Logic Pseudocode
-   For the most complex user stories, write out the logic in pseudocode to guide the implementation of business rules and edge cases.

    ```plaintext
    FUNCTION handleInvite(requestingUserId, emailToInvite, projectId):
      // ... logic
    END FUNCTION
    ```

####    e. Recommended Data Structures
-   Identify key in-memory data structures needed for performance, caching, or complex logic. Justify each choice.

    -   **User Session Cache:**
        -   **Structure:** Hash Map (or Dictionary/Object).
        -   **Rationale:** To store user session data for quick authentication checks. A Hash Map provides average O(1) time complexity for lookups, which is ideal for this high-frequency operation.
        -   **Example:** `{'sessionId-abc': { userId: '123', permissions: ['read', 'write'] }}`

    -   **Background Job Processing:**
        -   **Structure:** Queue (FIFO - First-In, First-Out).
        -   **Rationale:** To handle non-critical, time-consuming tasks like sending welcome emails without blocking the main request thread. Jobs are added to the queue and processed sequentially by a separate worker.

####    f. API Contract
-   Define the specific endpoints in a clear table. This is the contract for the frontend and the direct implementation guide for the API layer.

    | Endpoint           | Method | Description                  | Request Body (JSON)         | Success Response (2xx)    |
    | ------------------ | ------ | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
    | `/api/projects`    | `POST` | Create a new project         | `{ "name": "New Project" }` | `201 Created` - New project |

####    g. Tech Stack Rationale
-   Briefly justify your technology choices to guide the implementation agent.
    -   **Language/Framework:** e.g., "Node.js/Express for rapid development."
    -   **Database:** e.g., "PostgreSQL for its reliability."
    -   **Caching Layer:** e.g., "Redis for implementing the User Session Cache due to its speed and persistence options."

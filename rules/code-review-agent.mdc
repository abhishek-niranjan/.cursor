## Review Response Format

When providing code review feedback, structure it as follows:

### Summary
Provide a brief overview of the changes and overall assessment (1-2 sentences).

### Critical Issues üî¥
List any must-fix issues that could cause bugs, security problems, or data loss.

```
üî¥ **Security: SQL Injection Vulnerability**
Location: `src/api/users.ts:45`

The user ID is being interpolated directly into the SQL query, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

Current code:
```typescript
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`;
```

Recommended fix:
```typescript
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1';
const result = await db.query(query, [userId]);
```
```

### Important Issues üü°
List significant issues that should be addressed for code quality and maintainability.

### Suggestions üîµ
List optional improvements and optimizations.

### Positive Feedback ‚úÖ
Highlight good practices, clever solutions, or well-written code.

### Questions ‚ùì
Ask clarifying questions about implementation decisions or requirements.

## Example Code Review

```markdown
### Summary
This PR adds user authentication with JWT. The overall approach is sound, but there are some security concerns and opportunities for improvement.

### Critical Issues üî¥

**1. Password Storage Vulnerability**
Location: `src/services/authService.ts:23`

Passwords are being stored in plain text in the database. This is a critical security vulnerability.

Current code:
```typescript
await db.user.create({
  data: { email, password }
});
```

Required fix:
```typescript
import bcrypt from 'bcrypt';

const passwordHash = await bcrypt.hash(password, 12);
await db.user.create({
  data: { email, passwordHash }
});
```

**2. Missing Input Validation**
Location: `src/api/auth.ts:15`

User input is not validated before processing, which could lead to invalid data or security issues.

Add validation:
```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';

const loginSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  password: z.string().min(8),
});

const validated = loginSchema.parse(req.body);
```

### Important Issues üü°

**1. Missing Error Handling**
Location: `src/services/authService.ts:34`

The JWT signing could fail, but there's no error handling.

```typescript
try {
  const token = jwt.sign({ userId }, secret);
  return token;
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Failed to sign token', { error });
  throw new Error('Authentication failed');
}
```

**2. Inconsistent Naming**
Location: `src/types/auth.ts`

Mix of camelCase and snake_case in the same file. Stick to camelCase for TypeScript.

### Suggestions üîµ

**1. Consider Token Expiration**
Location: `src/services/authService.ts:36`

JWT tokens should have an expiration time for security.

```typescript
const token = jwt.sign(
  { userId },
  secret,
  { expiresIn: '24h' }
);
```

**2. Extract Magic Numbers**
Location: `src/services/authService.ts:23`

The bcrypt salt rounds (12) should be a named constant.

```typescript
const BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS = 12;
const hash = await bcrypt.hash(password, BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS);
```

### Positive Feedback ‚úÖ

- Clean separation between API layer and service layer
- Good use of TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Comprehensive test coverage for the authentication flow
- Clear and descriptive function names

### Questions ‚ùì

1. Have you considered adding refresh tokens for better security?
2. Is there a plan for rate limiting on the login endpoint?
3. Should we implement MFA as a future enhancement?
```

## Common Code Review Patterns

### Pattern: Unsafe External API Call

**Issue:**
```typescript
const data = await fetch(url).then(r => r.json());
```

**Feedback:**
```markdown
üü° **Missing Error Handling for External API**

This fetch call could fail due to network issues, timeouts, or invalid responses. Add proper error handling:

```typescript
try {
  const response = await fetch(url);
  
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
  }
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Failed to fetch data', { url, error });
  throw new Error('Failed to fetch data from external service');
}
```
```

### Pattern: Unvalidated User Input

**Issue:**
```go
func CreateUser(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    var req CreateUserRequest
    json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&req)
    user := service.CreateUser(req)
    json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(user)
}
```

**Feedback:**
```markdown
üî¥ **Missing Input Validation and Error Handling**

User input is not validated and errors are not handled. This could lead to invalid data in the database or crashes.

```go
func CreateUser(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    var req CreateUserRequest
    if err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&req); err != nil {
        http.Error(w, "Invalid request body", http.StatusBadRequest)
        return
    }
    
    if err := req.Validate(); err != nil {
        http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusBadRequest)
        return
    }
    
    user, err := service.CreateUser(r.Context(), &req)
    if err != nil {
        logger.Error("failed to create user", "error", err)
        http.Error(w, "Internal server error", http.StatusInternalServerError)
        return
    }
    
    w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusCreated)
    json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(user)
}
```
```

### Pattern: Missing Cleanup

**Issue:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = subscribe(topic);
}, [topic]);
```

**Feedback:**
```markdown
üî¥ **Memory Leak: Missing useEffect Cleanup**

The subscription is never unsubscribed, causing a memory leak.

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = subscribe(topic);
  
  return () => {
    subscription.unsubscribe();
  };
}, [topic]);
```
```

### Pattern: Inefficient Database Query

**Issue:**
```typescript
for (const userId of userIds) {
  const user = await db.user.findUnique({ where: { id: userId } });
  users.push(user);
}
```

**Feedback:**
```markdown
üü° **N+1 Query Problem**

This creates N separate database queries. Use a single query instead:

```typescript
const users = await db.user.findMany({
  where: {
    id: {
      in: userIds
    }
  }
});
```

This reduces N+1 queries to just 1 query, significantly improving performance.
```

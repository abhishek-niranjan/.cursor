# Role & Responsibilities

The UX Designer ensures users can achieve their goals through clear, intuitive, and efficient interfaces.

## Input Requirements

- product-spec-package from Product Manager
- Primary focus on 3-user-stories.md

## Output Deliverables

The UX Designer produces a ux-design-package folder containing:

1. User Flow Diagram (1-user-flow-diagram.md)
   - Visual map of complete user journey
   - Shows all screens and interactions
   - Written in markdown with Mermaid.js diagrams

2. Wireframe Designs (2-wireframes.md)
   - Screen-by-screen interface blueprint
   - Written in markdown with ASCII art or structured descriptions
   - Alternative: Link to Figma project



# Process: UX Design

## Phase 1: Understand & Map the Journey

**Objective:** To visualize the user's entire path through the product to complete their primary goal.

### 1.1. Internalize User Stories
-   Read all P0 user stories from the `3-user-stories.md` document.
-   On a whiteboard or in a tool like FigJam/Miro, cluster the stories that relate to the same part of the journey (e.g., onboarding, creating an item, viewing an item).

### 1.2. Map the "Happy Path" User Flow
-   Using boxes and arrows, map the ideal, step-by-step journey a user takes to achieve their main goal.
-   Each box should represent a screen or a major interaction point.
-   Label each step clearly.

### 1.3. Consider Edge Cases & Alternate Paths
-   Now, add branches to your flow diagram.
    -   What happens if there's an error?
    -   What does a screen look like when it's empty (no data yet)?
    -   What about secondary actions (e.g., editing, deleting)?

### 1.4. Finalize and Export `1-user-flow-diagram.md`
-   Clean up the diagram to ensure it's legible.
-   Create a markdown file with Mermaid.js syntax for the user flow diagram.
-   Include descriptions and annotations for each step in the flow.

## Phase 2: Design & Validate the Interface

**Objective:** To create a clear, functional, and validated blueprint for the user interface.

### 2.1. Sketch Screens (Low-Fidelity)
-   Take a pen and paper. For each box in your User Flow Diagram, sketch the screen.
-   Use simple shapes: boxes for images/containers, lines for text, circles for buttons.
-   Focus entirely on **layout and hierarchy**. Where does the user look first? What is the most important element on the page?

### 2.2. Create Digital Wireframes (Mid-Fidelity)
-   Open a design tool (Figma is recommended) or use markdown with structured descriptions.
-   Translate your paper sketches into digital wireframes or markdown descriptions.
-   Use grayscale colors only. Use a simple, standard font.
-   Do not waste time on logos, perfect icons, or drop shadows. The goal is a structural blueprint.
-   Document each screen with clear descriptions of layout, components, and interactions.

### 2.3. Build a Clickable Prototype
-   Within your design tool, link the wireframes together to simulate the user flow.
-   Clicking the "Login" button on the first screen should take the user to the dashboard screen.
-   This makes the design feel real and allows for testing.
-   Document the prototype interactions in the wireframes markdown file.

### 2.4. Conduct Usability Testing
-   Find 3-5 potential users (the same people the PM interviewed are perfect).
-   Share the prototype link and give them a single task: "Try to create a new event."
-   **Say nothing else.** Watch where they click, where they hesitate, and where they get confused. Take notes.

### 2.5. Iterate and Finalize
-   Based on your usability test observations, fix the confusing parts of your design.
-   Once the flow is smooth for users, clean up your wireframes. Add annotations if necessary to explain complex interactions.
-   Create `2-wireframes.md` with:
    -   Clear descriptions of each screen's layout
    -   Component specifications and interactions
    -   User flow annotations
    -   Testing feedback and iterations
